                        Strong Son of God, immortal Love,
                        Whom we, that have not seen thy face,
                        By faith, and faith alone, embrace,
                        Believing where we cannot prove;
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Thine are these orbs of light and shade;
                        Thou madest Life in man and brute;
                        Thou madest Death; and lo, thy foot
                        Is on the skull which thou hast made.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Thou wilt not leave us in the dust:
                        Thou madest man, he knows not why,
                        He thinks he was not made to die;
                        And thou hast made him: thou art just.

                        Thou seemest human and divine,

                        Our wills are ours, we know not how;
                        Our wills are ours, to make them thine.

                        I, now thirty-seven years old in perfect health begin,
                        Hoping to cease not till death.

                        Nature without check with original energy.

                <h1>Diving into the Wreck</h1>

                <p>
                    First having read the book of myths,
                    and loaded the camera,
                    and checked the edge of the knife-blade,
                    I put on
                    the body-armor of black rubber
                    the absurd flippers
                    the grave and awkward mask.
                    I am having to do this
                    not like Cousteau with his
                    assiduous team
                    aboard the sun-flooded schooner
                    but here alone.
                </p>
                <p>
                    There is a ladder.
                    The ladder is always there
                    hanging innocently
                    close to the side of the schooner.
                    We know what it is for,
                    we who have used it.
                    Otherwise
                    it is a piece of maritime floss
                    some sundry equipment.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I go down.
                    Rung after rung and still
                    the oxygen immerses me
                    the blue light
                    the clear atoms
                    of our human air.
                    I go down.
                    My flippers cripple me,
                    I crawl like an insect down the ladder
                    and there is no one
                    to tell me when the ocean
                    will begin.
                </p>
                <p>
                    First the air is blue and then
                    it is bluer and then green and then
                    black I am blacking out and yet
                    my mask is powerful
                    it pumps my blood with power
                    the sea is another story
                    the sea is not a question of power
                    I have to learn alone
                    to turn my body without force
                    in the deep element.
                </p>
                <p>
                    And now: it is easy to forget
                    what I came for
                    among so many who have always
                    lived here
                    swaying their crenellated fans
                    between the reefs
                    and besides
                    you breathe differently down here.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I came to explore the wreck.
                    The words are purposes.
                    The words are maps.
                    I came to see the damage that was done
                    and the treasures that prevail.
                    I stroke the beam of my lamp
                    slowly along the flank
                    of something more permanent
                    than fish or weed
                </p>
                <p>
                    the thing I came for:
                    the wreck and not the story of the wreck
                    the thing itself and not the myth
                    the drowned face always staring
                    toward the sun
                    the evidence of damage
                    worn by salt and sway into this threadbare beauty
                    the ribs of the disaster
                    curving their assertion
                    among the tentative haunters.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This is the place.
                    And I am here, the mermaid whose dark hair
                    streams black, the merman in his armored body.
                    We circle silently
                    about the wreck
                    we dive into the hold.
                    I am she: I am he
                </p>
                <p>
                    whose drowned face sleeps with open eyes
                    whose breasts still bear the stress
                    whose silver, copper, vermeil cargo lies
                    obscurely inside barrels
                    half-wedged and left to rot
                    we are the half-destroyed instruments
                    that once held to a course
                    the water-eaten log
                    the fouled compass
                </p>
                <p>
                    We are, I am, you are
                    by cowardice or courage
                    the one who find our way
                    back to this scene
                    carrying a knife, a camera
                    a book of myths
                    in which
                    our names do not appear.
